                            I have a solid understanding of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is the standard language for creating and structuring content on the web. I can effectively use HTML to create the backbone of any website, ensuring that the content is well-organized and accessible.

                            I am proficient in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which I use to style and design web pages. With CSS, I can control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation, allowing me to create responsive and visually appealing websites that provide a great user experience.

                            I am skilled in TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types. Using TypeScript, I can write more robust and maintainable code, catching errors early in the development process. This enhances code quality and developer productivity, especially in large codebases.

                            I have extensive experience with React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows me to create reusable UI components and manage the state of complex applications efficiently. Itâ€™s my go-to tool for developing dynamic and high-performance web applications.

                            I am proficient in Next.js, a React framework that provides server-side rendering and static site generation out-of-the-box. With Next.js, I can build fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable web applications. Its features like file-based routing and API routes streamline the development process, making it easier to deploy production-ready applications.
